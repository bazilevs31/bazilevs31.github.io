## How to learn to read in foreign alphabet in 30 minutes?

Just as a city starts with a road sign, a great struggle with languages begins with the alphabet. If you are lucky enough that you learn French or Spanish being an English speaker that's great. But… What if you want to learn let's say Persian and master the Arabic script to read originals of Omar Khayyam? Life is not that fabulous all of a sudden, isn’t it?
You enter a catch-22 now. To become good in something - you need to be able to read. To read - you need to be skilled at reading. Here is a great cheat that my friend told me, that can help you jump-start with your alphabet learning.

Don’t worry here is a cheat method to learn a new alphabet in 30(!) minutes. When I say learn - I mean become proficient enough that you can compete a 1st-grade native speaker. In just half an hour!!!

Let's use Greek Alphabet as an example.
Ok, let's start.

## Equipment:

* Your favorite story in your language.
* An alphabet in the language that you want to learn. I used this website to get one: <a href="http://www.rapidtables.com/math/symbols/greek_alphabet.html">Greek alphabet</a>
* And a table of how often do we use certain letters. You can find this website useful: <a href="http://www.sttmedia.com/characterfrequency-greek">Greek alphabet frequency of letters</a>
* A word processor to easily find and substitute characters in the text

## Method:

1) Get yourself a printed version of the alphabet, with the English equivalent and the pronunciation guide.

Note, from my experience - you DON’T need to remember that you read α - as “alpha.” Let it be just “a” for a start. That's good enough for studying.



2) Find the letters that you wouldn’t know how to read. Circle them out.
For example - “α" - is easy, it looks like English “a”. No need to remember it.

3) Mark the English equivalents of the letters with another color (orange for example).  Use the table of frequencies to help you select most used characters.

4) Let's focus on others like “Σ (σ) .”
Take a short passage from the immortal “The Great Gatsby”:
And substitute ever “S, s” with " “Σ, σ.” Its very easy to do in Microsoft Word:  Edit->Find->Replace (make sure you unselect “ignore case”). Now read the passage. I promise, by the end of this passage you will be a "Σigma MaΣter."

__S->Σ__ (sentence case “s”)

5) I suggest you do that with a longer piece of text. After you are done with S,s. Switch to the next most popular letter which is __N,n -> “Ν, ν”__. And so on.

## Finally:

After mastering all of your letters one by one. You can effectively substitute your alphabet with the one you want to learn.  Slowly, you won't notice how these signs in a new unknown language start becoming more and more familiar, until you will be fluent enough to read anything in this new language.
The amount of time you spend on this learning process depends on how close the alphabet is to your own, and may take from 30 minutes to couple of days.
