## What is the problem you are trying to solve?


97% of ALL patents filed are never used!  A single patent costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, this translates to millions of dollars for a stack of fancy paperweights.The reason for this is simple: these patents solve NON-EXISTENT PROBLEMS. The key to a valuable patent and the next big business is simple, know the problem you are solving.

How does one find out if they are solving a problem? Easy, just ask mom! Imagine you have the coolest new app, which digitizes all of your mothers’ favourite recipes and even uploads it to the cloud for her automatically! You spent months locked in your room frantically coding, optimizing and bug testing. You show off your slick new app to your mother only to realize…. She already has everything written down in her notebook.

One of the best books that teaches you to ask the right questions for your interview is "The mom test" by Rob Fitzpatrick http://momtestbook.com/. Personally, it was an eye opening book that made me understand people's feedback in a completely new way. It emphasized "reading between the lines" and understanding what person really thinks vs what he/she tells you.
