## How to make a perfect morning latte at home?


Once upon a time I was a kid and never drank coffee.
I was young and naive and didn't realize that how cool my life would become as I grow up. I didn't know that I will discover a magical drink, with majestic aroma and great taste. It will give me energy in the morning and make me feel like life is worth living. Of course, I am talking about coffee.

Today I will talk to you about my morning beverages and how I make them. We will cover:

* Perfect morning latte with foam
* London Fog
* Making a heavenly foam with mixture of milk and condensed milk

Usually, it takes me  only 4 minutes to make two cups in the morning. I hope it can make your mornings better as well ☕️👏
