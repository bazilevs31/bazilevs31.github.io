## About me and my blog

Hi, my name is Vasilii Triandafilidi
<a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/campus-community/meet-our-students/triandafilidi-vasilii">. I am a third year Ph.D. student at
the University of British Columbia. I work under the supervision of Prof. Savvas Hatzikiriakos, Prof. Joerg Rottler, and Prof. John Madden.
In the past, I had a pleasure working in the Prof. Norman's group
under the supervision of Dr. Stegailov from Russian Academy of Science.

In my research, I focus on investigating properties of matter using Method of Molecular Dynamics. Molecular Dynamics
computational tool that treats the material as a system of interacting particles.

## So why do I write this blog?

I write this blog mostly because I want to keep track of the things that I encounter in my everyday life of a graduate student. I also believe in an open-source and reproducible science. I am very much against inventing bicycles over and over again. The best way to avoid it is to share, to talk and to collaborate with as many people as you can.
Remember, science isn't a zero-sum game - together we can build substantial synergies an capitalize on them.

In this blog besides personal learning, I will cover several topics:

* Research on polymers, polyelectrolyte gels, and sensors
* Computer simulation tools (in particular Molecular Dynamics)
* Python/Bash programming
* Mac OS X/ Linux based systems

I hope reading this blog would be beneficial to you. You can say thank you by commenting on this blog or by starting your own blog. I will provide instructions on how to set it up later on.
