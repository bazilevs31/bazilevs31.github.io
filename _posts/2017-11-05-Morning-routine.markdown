## Morning routine

7 am, and my alarm clock goes off.

I don't like alarms; I prefer to wake to up naturally. But today I have to wake up early and can't afford to sleep in.

I go to the living room get my 10 days of Headspace meditation app and meditate for 5 minutes. Concentrating on your body, on your surrounding noises, your breath.
Slowly my head clears up; nothing bothers me anymore, blue skies are in my head.

 I drink a glass of water to help my body. I know that if I dehydrate my head will start exploding. With my clear head, I open Spotify and turn on "Kings of Leon, Find me."  With this song, I do 20 squats, 20 Indian push-ups, and 40 regular ones. I finish it up with a 1-minute plank. After warming up my body enough, it is time to stretch it out with some slowww stretching.

I am almost done with my morning routine. It is time for the last thing.

I go to the shower, put my bucket into the bath and fill it in with the coldest water. I bring some ice from the kitchen just to make sure it is as chilled as it could get. I get into the bath and pour it over myself. My morning routine is complete.

I go to the kitchen, put some coffee in my stove espresso maker and put it on the stove. I heat up some milk, foam it with my little electric foamer and mix it up with my espresso. I get my favorite morning latte.

I sip my coffee, and suddenly a warmth of firing neurons hugs my head. I feel awake; I feel energetic, it is time to do something.

## Active vs Reactive activities

I turn on my computer and write the plan for today. I use Evernote as my digital brain, and it is incredible! I will write a separate post on how I use it, but I strongly recommend you get one!
There is a lot of stuff to do.  Between my Ph.D. project, a start-up program Innovation OnBoard that I have co-founded, my home chores and other miscellaneous items - it quickly fills in my schedule. It is important to write these things down. Otherwise, your brain will start thinking of ways to remember - and you won't be able to have a good time. You will always be working.

There is another reason to write it down the first thing you do when you sit down. Writing things down is an "active, not reactive move," it activates your pre-frontal cortex which is responsible for your self-reflection. According to Ray Dalio (very successful trader and good friend of Bill Gates) mistakes + self-reflection = improvement which leads to learning which leads you to new horizons. But morning is the only time where we can self-reflect. As soon as we open our email - we go into the reactive mode, where we just try to survive. No self-reflection happens and hence no learning. We become like a squirrel on a treadmill.

Here is a sample list of things I want to work on. I start with global things that I want to advance myself in. I write down why I need it and always finilize it with actionable items. Otherwise these things will be forgotten as soon as I stop typing.

__PhD__

Global things to work on:

    * ....
    *
    *

Why:

    *
    *

Action items:

    * Submit simulations on Compute Canada supercomputers
    * Keep on finalizing the graphs
    * Fit the data with theoretical predictions
    * Keep on updating my journal article that I am writing.
    (By the way, if you are writing a paper with at least couple of formulas
        there and value collaboration - use Authorea - Google Docs for scientific documents)

__Innovation OnBoard__

Global things to work on:

Why:

Action items:

    * Keep on doing interviews with the participating teams
    * Compile the information and find ways our team can help out participants
    * Browse through my network and think about people we can introduce groups to potential mentors
    * We need more established advisory boards with meetings and more members

And so on. Usually, my list is way bigger. Right now I am using Todoist to keep track of my personal and IOB errands.

After writing things down, I pack up my stuff and either go to meetings or go to a coffee shop to work on my stuff.
