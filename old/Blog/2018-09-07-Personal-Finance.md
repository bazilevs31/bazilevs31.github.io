#Personal finance





For many years of independent living I have always gone with the flow. At the back of my head I have always known that if shit hits the fan my parents can always support me and provide me with some help. However, time has come for me to realize where I am going and become financially literate. I want to be smart with the money and try to manage it effectively. The first step of effective management is to start tracking it! I have set-up a simple system to do that. It is super ghetto and simple and the only thing that it requires is the diligence!

Trying to understand how to run my personal finance. 

1. Create an approximate plan. A simple spredsheet with costs and income from different sources.

It may look like something like this:

Very simple, but it gives me an idea of how much money I have, how much money I will have and how much money I am going to spend. Note here that when we are talking about the cash advances we are putting the values at the begining of the month. So the beginging of Oct 2019 (end of September) is my terminal date for which I am creating the financial goal.

Now based on that I can set myself a goal to have $8806 on my bank account at the end of September 2019. This money will give me a safety pillow for a couple of months after I graduate and am looking for a job or starting my start-up. So, ..

2. Set yourself a goal. My goal is to have at least 3 months of expenses on my chequing account. So, in my case, I am spending $2000/month. I have to have at least \$6000 at the end of September 2019.


3. After you set yourself a goal start diligently following your finance. I do that the following way:

I essentially take the same spredsheet, but will modify the values as I go, so it will adapt accordingly. But since I have still put the predicted values there as well I can see where the trends are going.

I have also downloaded the Mint app on my phone to see my day to day finances and analyze if I should spend that $5 on extra latte.
