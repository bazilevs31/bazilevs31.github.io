As I open my computer and start typing these words, I use a standard QWERTY keyboard. Did you know that there was a way better keyboard developed by Dvorak? This console allows you to type 1.5 times faster. So why haven't we switched to it then? Well, the reason is simple - we don't give enough sh*t about it to change our lives. Unlike engineers regular people aren't obsessed with products and technology, they care about how this product can help them change their lives. How this product can bring value to them, enough value, so they care.

**<u>Problem:</u>**

A young entrepreneur Michael has his product on creating a device that will measure the number of breaths a person makes in one day. From the first glance, it looks evident that people may need it. But how do we make sure? In this post, we will look through the methods, how Michael can verify his hypothesis.

According to Lean LaunchPad principle, the answer is simple: we have to use the scientific method of making a hypothesis, running experiments to verify it and testing if that is true.

Method:

1. Write down your idea - hypothesis
2. Identify possible tests that will help you "prove" your idea is right or wrong
3. Find resources which can help you to test your ideas
4. Analyzing the feedback
5. Repeating this procedure enough times to make statistically relevant claims (usually \sim 50) 

**<u>Preliminary research:</u>**

As a visual learner, Michael first writes his idea on a piece of paper. He creates a mind map of the problem he is solving. Mike needs to identify the players involved in the ecosystem,  experts, decision-makers, users, beneficiaries in the field. He recognizes the missing gaps in his knowledge and writes down the plan to find resources that will help him to fill the missing gaps.

The resources that he needs could be classified into two groups:

1. Easy to get: books, close friends, internet, online courses, youtube, market research, scholarly articles, patents
2. Hard to get: conversations with experts in the field, expensive market research, big groups of potential customers

What about online surveys you would ask? I, personally, have seen very few people pulling online surveys off. When the numbers are as low as 50-100 people, you are better off talking to people in person. Few people answer online surveys, and even if they do they are not very reliable.

It is important to remember to start with 1 and move to the 2. It will save a ton of time and precious resources and allows to save time for the experts. The first group of resources are relatively easy to get and should be analyzed before Mike moves to the second category. As good as internet articles could be they can't don't have all the information, especially about the product that hasn't yet been discovered. 

He opens his LinkedIn account and looks for someone who is proficient in his field.  No worries if you don't know anyone. I am sure if he has at least a third connection he would be able to use that. He asks his friend John to introduce him to Dr. Emily Docmann a doctor who is studying problems connected with lungs. Mike sends a possible e-intro text to John and gets introduced to her. After that Mike schedules a meeting with Emily. He prefers a face-to-face meeting since it is the only way to get an honest feedback and analyze the sub-verbal clues.

**<u>HOMEWORK:</u>**

Before the meeting, Michael looks through Emily's LinkedIn profile and sees what they have in common, what is the area Emily is specializing, where did she go to school and what hobbies does she have. This is important to make a personalized human connection. Based on that information he creates a detailed conversation plan that he doesn't have to follow, but that will help him a lot to start the conversation and establish a rapport.

This is why it is essential to do the Category 1 sources of information. You want to ask experts - the unique information that only they have enough qualification to answer. Plan your time wisely, and make sure you know how much time you have to ask the person.

Also usually people want to understand what is the product you are working on and where they could help you. Mike needs to be careful here. On the one hand he has to explain enough information that will allow a productive conversation, on the other hand, he can not disclose too much information since it can nullify your patent claims.

The best advice here is to focus more on the problem you are trying to solve and describe your device in general words. At the later stages, when you will have much more detailed conversations one may ask people to sign Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that will prevent people to steal and run away with your idea. At the early stages, no one will do any such thing.

Another advice would be to focus on listening instead of explaining. You are there to hear the feedback from the person, not to sell anything to her.

The last tip before the event is to write down an elevator pitch of 30 seconds - 1 minute that you could explain everyone your idea with. 

**<u>At the meeting:</u>**

So Mike meets with the doctor and chit chats for a bit to establish a rapport. 

Now here comes the hard part. Conducting the actual interview.

There are several main tips here that he needs to follow:

1. Ask unbiased, open-ended questions. Don't put words into person's mouth

I usually start with a list of simple questions and try to follow up on the reply and pull more elaborate answers.

Good questions: 

- What do you think about this?
- Tell me more about your research procedure
- Could you describe me the kind of patients that you are analyzing ?

Bad questions:

- Do you think breath analysis device with this functionality is a good invention
- Could you get tired by spending more than 2 hours with a patient

1. Listen  "between lines," analyze the words choice, look for non-verbal clues

It is critical to see if a person is hesitant when she describes that to you. See if the problem is described as a must-be-solved or it "would be nice if it's solved." 

1. WRITE stuff down.

It is super important to document everything. All of your steps have to be planned, written down and saved in a place where you could find your information. An easy way to structure your notes would be Evernote, a.k.a my digital brain. It is awesome and free (freemium). The best part about it is that you can scan your hand-written notes using Evernote app and save it as a note. Evernote indexes the file, and you would be able to search the handwritten information using Evernote. I will write a separate blog post about how I use Evernote.

1. After you are done discussing your project you can ask suggestions of other people that you may need to talk to. 
   - Could you recommend me anyone else that I should talk to?
   - Do you mind making an e-introduction? I will send out a possible e-intro later on.


**<u>After the interview</u>**

Make sure you go through the information that you have written down. See how it relates to the industry mindmap that you have identified. Has this feedback agreed with your assumptions or not. One interview is not enough to make decisions yet and pivot with your solution. You need at least 50 legit interviews!

**<u>Additional tips</u>**

- If you are not from Canada, you can tap into the networks of the country of your origin
- A neat trick that I have learned from the Masters of Scale Brian Chesky (co-founder of Airbnb). He suggests a mental exercise to analyze your product/service. He goes from examining 1-star experience and moving further to 12 stars. In Michael's case, for counting breaths, it would be.
  - 3-star experience: no one cares about your product. It barely analyzes the breath count and does that inaccurately
  - 6-star: people like it, the breath is analyzed pretty accurately and saved onto the iPhone
  - 7 star: The iPhone visualizes the obtained information in a cool way
  - 8 star: if something is wrong with breathing the service will contact your physician, and he will use that information the next time you visit him
  - 9 star: The physician gets informed about your breathing patterns and calls you himself
  - 10 star: The physician receives info about your breathing patterns, meets with you in person and consults you on your health
  - ...
    It is evident that "high stars" are more surrealistic, but they help you to stretch your imagination and create a better service/product for your customers
- Another cool trick from Brian Chesky: What should I do to make you pee your pants and use our product and tell your friends about it.
- Keep in mind, sometimes (rarely but still) people don't know what they want, and it is essential to read between the lines. If entrepreneurs couldn't read these subtle clues - we would still drive horses and use command-line terminals without Graphical User Interface.
