## The future of mankind. Wisdom vs. Knowledge

__Why wisdom maybe the only thing that will save our world from self-destruction__



Remembrance Day is a very sad holiday when we remember millions of people that gave their lives for their country. It is a day to remember bravery, valiance, and courage.

But it is also a reminder how crazy our brains are. There are two "people" living in your mind. There is your limbic system - your animal you, the Caveman you the person who supposed to live in jungles and caves and not having weaponry of mass destruction. And there is a philosopher, scientist you which lives in your pre-frontal cortex. The second guy helps you create, invent and produce. The former helps you have emotions, survive. The problem starts that both of these people are living in the same body and can take control of you. When your limbic system does take control of a cave man - he can kill a person or a group. When it took control of our politicians in the 20th century - it ended up killing tens of millions.

Why does it have to happen this way and what do we do about it? I don't know, but I have a couple of guesses.

Our pre-frontal cortex is fantastic in making connections of the surrounding world and thinking logically. It can help us to analyze complex patterns and come up with remarkably tricky solutions. The most common thoughts are laying inside of your brain in your reptilian parts. For example, when you have to breathe - it is entirely responsible for that. 

Our decisions can be made in 2 ways: top-down (your scientist brain tells your reptilian brain) or bottom-up(your animal brain tells your scientist brain). 

Let's imagine you think of drawing your favorite apple tree. Your brain tries to go to the neuron:1 which has a picture of an apple. The neurons neighboring the neuron:2 have information about color, trees, taste. When you think of the taste it tries to reach your memory about emotions you had when you first time tried your favorite kind of apple, your whole body starts feeling warm with this memory because these neurons reached your emotional parts that commanded your body to start feeling good through a drug called dopamine.

Then you are trying to iron fist your brain and tell yourself that you need to concentrate on apple trees and not stay in the emotional part forever. So you come back your neuron path to the apple and go to the apple tree side. Your brain again tries to remember the tree you have seen some time in your life, maybe the one you tried to climb, the one you accidentally climbed and broke your leg. It again goes to the emotional part, which is close to your animal brain and brings back the feeling of anxiety that you felt when you showed your mom that you didn't listen to her and climb that tree. It brings back the cortisol and adrenaline drugs (the stress drugs) in your body, and you start feeling anxious and boiling once again. 

The feelings of warmth through dopamine or boiled anxiety through cortisol and adrenaline can change your mood and affect your decisions. Suddenly you may stop thinking about drawing the apple tree whatsoever and rip apart the piece of paper. Or it can create the feeling of warmth that will help you enjoy drawing and create a masterpiece. 

I described a simple, harmless scenario where the stakes are very low. Different people, every day are facing different situations and have different responsibilities. Some people are responsible for the lives of millions. But the truth is, they are also people. They also have an animal and scientist brains. They also have the dopamines, cortisol, and adrenaline in their blood that can change their mood and have the potential to start bloody wars or facilitate the creation of a new educational program for children.

Why then are some people better at making sure their emotional brain don't high jack their decision making? Knowledge? - No. 20th century was filled with knowledge, but it didn't help to stop our emotional brain from hijacking our behavior. The answer is wisdom!

The knowledge is just the accumulation of knowledge in your brain. This information could be useless, in case you don't apply it. Wisdom is something bigger. It is the ability to use your knowledge, test it and select the methods that work as your operational framework. In other words, wisdom is the framework of your actions. 

When you are studying in grade 2 - you don't have much knowledge. Your basic framework is relatively simple; you operate with only two terms good and bad, most of your decisions are based on your emotions, as they say, "speak what you think." Your frontal cortex which is still developing is mostly reaching out to your reptilian brain, gets emotion there, goes back to your frontal cortex, and you make a decision based on that. As you grow up, you increase the amount of information you know and here comes a need to structure your information. We have created different specializations. When you are asked to answer a question about Shakespeare, you won't go into calculus handbook. You will look in the literature book. This is wisdom.

With the exponential growth of knowledge, technology, and the tools we could use we have accumulated tremendous amounts of information in our heads that fills it up. We haven't managed to come up with practical methods to structure the information efficiently, to come up with general frameworks to use the information. We know a lot, but we don't know how to use it. We don't have wisdom.

On the frontier of our personal lives, we have a lot of stuff going on. Some people are dating, having many partners over their lives, some don't, etc. The variety of options has exponentially increased in last 40 years. But we as humans didn't stop and think about how we structure this information in our heads. How do we create effective frameworks, that will guide our decisions and prevent our emotions to take over of our behavior and ruin our lives?

On the frontier of world politics, a lot has changed. Countries are globalizing, robotization is killing thousands of old jobs, technology coming to the domain where we don't have established policies (like human cloning, genetic theory). It is a big challenge for our politicians and ourselves to get a hold of this information. To create a framework, to have the wisdom to cope with the knowledge. In my opinion, this would be the most significant test of the 21st century.

Our politicians of the 20th century didn't do a great job creating and using this wisdom, and they paid a big price of millions of lives. Let's hope that we have learned from their mistakes and steer our lives into the future.
