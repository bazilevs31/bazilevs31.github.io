Part 3: Vancouver

However, I learned the lesson for the next language that I tackled: Persian (Farsi). I started learning Farsi in the same way as German, using dynamic learning and keeping it simple: only easy grammar first. I asked my friend to write down the "apple sentence" that I had for my German learning, and I started to use the phrases and dialogues. I would learn another word and use the acquired words in those sentences. "I eat an apple; I eat bread, I eat a â€¦". I would learn other verbs and use these words every time I see a Farsi speaking person. Luckily, there were a lot of Iranians in Engineering UBC. Here instead of learning the dialogues, I would learn funny stories that have essential vocabulary by heart. My Farsi was improving, but the best part would be that I could use the language with people every day. I could start my conversation with an easy small talk and then demonstrate my skills in learning a funny story by heart. As a result in 2-3 months, I could more or less to hold a conversation. In 8-12 months I was conversationally fluent. I could make jokes, use colloquialisms and discuss poetry.
